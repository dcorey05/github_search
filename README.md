# github_search
Demonstrate GitHub user search

## Funcationality
Can search for usernames and page through results. Results are cached for a page.

## CI/CD
Using Azure DevOps. Yml file for building the solution, testing, and publishing the artifact. Deployed to Azure Storage as a static website

## If we were going to prod:
I would write more meaningful tests

Spend time on the UI

Add error handling

Add spinners / indicator for web request pending and block overlapping requests

Add website CDN or caching
